    <h1 id="title">The Legend of Frost</h1>

    <p id="story"> |Page 1|
      <br />Many things could motivate a person to leave the comfort of home for the harshness of battle and conflict. Money and power. Fame and glory. For the greater good. For country and family. But the one thing that could motivate a man to do things unthinkable, is Vengeance. 

      <br />So, when the portal opened upon a bare hill, covered in ice, snow, and frost-stipped trees. The Druid Harald Wildwolf was the first to step through the pulsating violet disk. Shimmering sparks flew from the edge of the gateway into the surrounding wind, only to be blown away in the gale. Away from the bustling, crowded city of Ultengrand. The contrast from the mildly warm, magically shielded city to the perpetual blizzard was bone-chilling.
      <br />Harald immediately muttered a spell to create a shield of light and warmth to give some protection from the freezing wind that had already started to make his hands shiver and shake. With a burst of yellow light and the stench of ozone, the magical barrier was created and Harald waved the others of his party through the portal.
      <br />Marius, a noble from Ultengrand, who Harald personally thought was arrogant and egotistical, though he could not dispute the man's skills with a blade.
      <br />Last was Denis, a short man who had an affinity with conjuration magic, specifically portal creation. He waved his hand and with a flare of power, closed the portal which had been used to ferry the group so close to their destination.

      <br />“How long can the mages hold up the shield over Ultengrad?” asked Harald with a grunt of exertion, the blizzard seemed to be picking up pace and the magical shield he held up was showing the first signs of buckling under the pressure. He reinforced it with a burst of light and power.
      <br />“About three weeks, perhaps more”, shouted Denis, his voice seeming far away with the sound of whipping wind lashing out around the three of them. “Estimating all of the parabolic factors for such a complex ritual is rather difficult with so many-”
      <br />“Alright, alright, stop it with the magic talk.” Marius grinned, “Besides we should arrive at Elisif's stronghold by tomorrow. And all we have to do is smash her snowglobe, Right?” he gripped the hilt of his sword as if said item was right in front of him and he could crush it then and there.
      <br />“It’s not a snowglobe! It is a crystalline sphere made with the tears-” Denis paused at the annoyed look Marius gave him, before slumping in place. “Yes, all we need to do is destroy the sphere and the blizzard will stop. Alternatively, killing Elisif will halt the ritual after a few days' time. Even if we accomplish nothing else.”
      <br />“Might I suggest we get moving then!” Harald said, non-too kindly. “I won't be able to hold this blizzard at bay for all eternity! We still have six miles to trudge through this!” He gestured at their feet, where they all had sunk a full two feet into the fresh snow. Such conditions would make travel unbearably more difficult. 

      <br />|Page 3|

      <br />Denis and Marius look at each other, conveying some hidden words through their expressions that Harald did not take the time to study. Denis looked at a compass tied to his belt before pointing off in a seemingly random direction into the blindingly white blizzard. “There should be a village in that direction, we can take shelter there for the night.”
      <br />Harald nodded and started the snow march to the village. 
      <br />“I still say we need a proper plan,” Denis said worryingly. “We can't assume Elisif is going to be so preoccupied with the sphere that she won't notice us. Or that she won't stop the ritual entirely to protect herself.”
      <br />“I have a plan.” Harald declared after a beat.
      <br />“You? A plan? What? Is it to sneak up behind her while we take the brunt of her attack?” Marius said with a sneer.
      <br />In place of an answer, Harald opened his cloak to show an assortment of daggers, pouches, and other odd pieces that the other two ignored in favor of staring at the giant scorpion-like stinger. 
      <br />“Is that from a Manticore tail!?” Denis hissed, losing his normally controlled demeanor.
      <br />Even Marius was looking pale at the sight. Manticores were extremely dangerous, a few drops of the poison in that stinger would kill a mammoth in moments.
      <br />He’d had the tail for a few years now, the Manticore had been an elderly thing, though that had not stopped its insatiable appetite for living things. When it had ventured into Harald’s forest in search of prey he had swiftly put down the abomination with an enchanted arrow to the back of the head. 

      <br />|Page 4|

      <br />“The plan is simple,” Harald said, ignoring the reactions of the other two males. “We coat our weapons in the venom and get close enough to give her a scratch. After that, we break the sphere. The end. We're done” 
      <br />Neither Denis nor Marius tried dissuading him of the plan. It was sound on all levels, though they have to be careful administering the poison to weapons. Harald, as the unofficial healer of the group, would have no hope of stopping such potent venom from killing somebody. 
      <br />As one, the group refocused on maneuvering through the heavy snow, none saw any point in wasting precious energy on banter when they would need all they had simply to get past the biting frost and howling wind that had seemingly turned against them in an attempt to slow them down. Harald would not be surprised if that was exactly what they were doing.
      <br />As he walked, Harald thought of his companions. He had only known them for a week, but he already knew he would not like them. 
      <br />Normally it would be a dislike of quiet annoyance. Marius was a nobleman from a prominent family. Which was why he was here. He had money, and so he could afford magical items that made even Harald a bit envious. His sword and shield in particular had magic wafting off of them like the steam from a hot spring. The man was also arrogant and very shortsighted in matters that did not concern Ultangrad itself. Which was the crux of the matter for Harald.
      <br />As a Druid, Harald was sworn to protect the natural world, but Marius had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for what happened to Harald’s home.
      <br />|Page 5|
      <br />Denis was a different case. The man was smart, and on his way to becoming a talented mage, but was blind to the flaws of his superiors. Even the best Archmage made mistakes, and Denis had 
      <br />refused to even hear the possibility that they had made a desperate and foolish action in raising the shield around Ultengrad in the manner they did.
      <br />It was only because most of the damage had already been done, and that he had ensured no more damage would be done, that Harald had not mentioned anything to them beyond snide remarks.
