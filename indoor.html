        <div class=write> When Covid-19 started I took up a hobbie of writting stories to pass the time. I kept writting, and while I have many failed storries that I hope will never see the light of day, I have a few that I'm rather proud of and one one that I am working on right now. below is a link to a single page of a short story I wrote. and the picture to the right is of the setting for the fanfiction I am writing right now.

I oddly stopped playing videogames entierly. not for lack of intrest, mind you, I have several games I would like to try an play. but not real motivation to try and play them. the only game I play right now is a game called Timber Born that is currently in earlly access.</div></p>
