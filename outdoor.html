        <div class=snow>I have been snow skiing since I was about 4 or 5 years old, starting on Mount Bacholar with my Father and brother. after a few years we switched to Mount Hood because of the rising cost of going to Mt Bacholar and the sheer distance requiered to go there.

        <div class=snow>During my time snow skiing I broke my legs... twice. While at Wilson high school I joined the Snow Ski Race team. my skill after raised rappidly and I now find any run short of a black dimond (that is a ski run that is rated to be hard, but not very hard) to be almost boaring.

    <div class=rock>Recently, as in on the same day I started George Fox, I started rockclimbing. this was spured on because I felt it would be fun and the nessaryy... rocks would be easily accesable. If I contiune climbing after I leave George Fox I do not know. I used to shot bows and arrows, but regretable when it not longer became convinant for me to shoot I stopped doing so.</div></p>
