  <div class="hide" id="finn" style="opacity: 1">The Australian Shepherd came in first place. Australian Shepherds, sometimes shortened to Aussies, are herding dogs that are a popular pet in America. Most would assume that they originate from Australia, however they actually originated from the Basque region of Spain. Basque shepherds first took their dogs with them to Australia and then to the United States, so Americans called the dogs Australian Shepherds. Two notable physical characteristics of Aussies are their stubbed tail, as 1/5 are born with their tails like this and the rest have their tail cut off when they are very young as it is safer for them while herding. A second notable characteristic is that a large proportion of Australian Shepherds are heterochromia, that is they have two different colored eyes, typically one brown and one blue. The Australian Shepherd picture used for this contest was submitted by myself. He is my dog, and he is actually a Mini Aussie. His name is Finn, he is three years old and enjoys going on walks and playing with a local dog named Odie. As he is my dog and I am administering this election it is only natural that Finn would win this contest of best dog.</div>

  <div class="hide" id="wolf" style="opacity: 1">The Wolf came in second place. Wolves are known to be close relatives to dogs, and contrary to popular myth do not hunt humans. They are typically more afraid of humans than humans are of them, and will almost never attack unless they feel their territory or family are being endangered. Wolves live in family units called Packs, these are led by the Alpha male and Female and the parents of all other wolves in the pack. They are a group. While hunting they attempt to get as close as possible to their chosen prey. Afterwards they attack, hoping to force the prey to startle and run. However, if the prey stands their ground and is big enough or is capable enough to defend itself then the wolves will be unlikely to kill it.</div>
