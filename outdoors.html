        I have been snow skiing since I was about 4 or 5 years old, starting on Mount Bacholar with my Father and brother. after a few years we switched to Mount Hood because of the rising cost of going to Mt Bacholar and the sheer distance requiered to go there.

        During my time snow skiing I broke my legs... twice. While at Wilson high school I joined the Snow Ski Race team. my skill after raised rappidly and I now find any run short of a black dimond (that is a ski run that is rated to be hard, but not very hard) to be almost boaring.

          My dad joined a water skiing show team called Portland Water spetacular. when I was born I became a member of the team by default. We often do shows for crowds in areas like West Linn, Lake Oswego, and other lakes and rivers.
